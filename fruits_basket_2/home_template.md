# Welcome to フルーツバスケット Vol. 2 (Collector's Edition)

We have read Volume 1 as the [Beginner Book Club](https://community.wanikani.com/t/x/19766).

Now we're continuing with Volume 2 as an offshoot book club.

If you want to take part... just buy the book and join in the discussion! Or maybe catch up on the previous volume first? There's a membership poll further down.

Not sure if this is for you? Check out the sample pages in the [Nomination Post](https://community.wanikani.com/t/x/19766/3100) - remember that your fellow book club members and the vocab sheet will be here to help you out though ;)

## Buy the Book

We are reading the **Collector's Edition** - if you are reading the eBook you'll need to buy *two* volumes of the original. See the reading schedule to find out which volumes to buy!

**Warning:** there is a spin-off series called 'Another', which has a very similar-looking front cover to the Collector's Edition.
