=== Intermediate ===

Have a look at the List of Proposed Books section in the first post for details on each book. Every book has a Natively level associated with it which is annotated in the poll in square brackets after the book’s name ([this Natively list](https://learnnatively.com/list/1881865d37/) contains all nominated books if you want to have a look at the gradings in detail).

Do not rely solely on Natively level when making a choice. Please have a look at nomination posts if you haven’t already.

**Expected reading pace:** We aim to read books at ~15 pages per week (that number might vary a bit throughout, depending on the book’s breaks and chapters). For manga, depending on difficulty and chapter length, we will probably read one to several chapters per week. The pick’s exact reading schedule will be negotiated before the book club kicks off.

**Short book rule:** If the first place is taken by a pick that will take us 6 weeks or less to read, we will read the one in second place directly after it, without running a poll in between. I haven't checked in detail, but I'd assume that this basically applies in case one of the manga wins the poll.

**Start of Book Club**: We will start the next book on June 18th (after a one-week break).

**Poll duration**: The poll will be closed on . You can choose **up to 5 options**.

Oh, and if somebody could update the thread title to "Now voting!" that would be great. Thanks!

Have a look at the List of Proposed Books section in the [first post](https://community.wanikani.com/t/x/44685) for details on each book. If you are interested, you can have a look at the books' Natively levels [through this list](https://learnnatively.com/list/a82316ad0a/). The Natively level is also annotated in the poll in square brackets after each book’s name.

<h2>Do not rely solely on the levels when making a choice. Please have a look at the nomination posts and text samples if you haven’t already.</h2>

**Expected reading pace:** The proposals fall into two categories, **Fast** and **Hard**. We aim to read fast books at 30-50 pages per week and hard books at ~15 pages per week (that number might vary a bit throughout, depending on the book’s breaks and chapters). For manga, depending on difficulty and chapter length, we will probably read one to several chapters per week. The pick’s exact reading schedule will be negotiated before the book club kicks off.

**Start of Book Club**: We will start the next book on **April 27th** (after a one-week break).

**Poll duration**: The poll will be closed on . You can choose up to **5 options**.
