=== Intermediate ===

Have a look at the List of Proposed Books section in the first post for details on each book. Every book has a difficulty associated with it (based on book club members voting, thus subjective) out of 5, where 1 means “no effort at all” and 5 means “impossible, even with everyone’s help”. The difficulty is annotated in the poll in square brackets after the book’s name.

Do not rely solely on difficulty when making a choice. Please have a look at nomination posts if you haven’t already.

**Expected reading pace:** We aim to read books at ~15 pages per week (that number might vary a bit throughout, depending on the book’s breaks and chapters). For manga, depending on difficulty and chapter length, we will probably read one to several chapters per week. The pick’s exact reading schedule will be negotiated before the book club kicks off.

**Short book rule:** If the first place ist taken by a book that will take us 6 weeks or less to read, we will read the book in second place directly after it, without running a poll in between. I haven't checked in detail, but I'd assume that this basically applies in case one of the manga wins the poll.

**Start of Book Club**: We will start the next book on XXX (after a one-week break).

**Poll duration**: I will close the poll within a week (and most likely before that), whenever it looks like voting has dried up. You can choose **up to 5 options**.

**Expected reading pace:** The proposals fall into two categories, **Fast** and **Hard**. We aim to read fast books at 30-50 pages per week and hard books at ~15 pages per week (that number might vary a bit throughout, depending on the book’s breaks and chapters). For manga, depending on difficulty and chapter length, we will probably read one to several chapters per week. The pick’s exact reading schedule will be negotiated before the book club kicks off.

**Start of Book Club**: We will start the next book on **July 3rd** (after a one-week break).
