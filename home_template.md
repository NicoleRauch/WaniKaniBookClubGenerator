**Note:** There are two different versions available: The Kadokawa Bunko edition (beige-coloured with bananas), 200 pages, published in 1998, and the Shinchou Bunko edition (grey with tulips), 197 pages, published in 2002.
I compared the first few paragraphs of both and could not find any differences text-wise, but they might differ wrt. page breaks. This will be pointed out in the reading schedule.

 ## Reading Schedule

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Week 1|Oct 5th|18|7%|それほど驚いた出会いだったのだ。|12|
|Week 2|Oct 12th|32|14%|神に心から感謝していた。|13|
|Week 3|Oct 19th|43|19%|出なくては。|12|
|Week 4|Oct 26th|57|26%|素足がふるえた。|13|
|Week 5|Nov 2nd|73|33%|「お電話ありがとう。」と言った。|14|
|Week 6|Nov 9th|86|40%|心に満ちてしまう。|12.5|
|Week 7|Nov 16th|101*|48%|いやな悲しさでいっぱいになっていった。|15|

#### Moonlight Shadow

The book contains a second (totally unrelated) story called "Moonlight Shadow" which is 49 pages long.
We might also read it with the book club while we're at it.
Here are two possible reading schedules for it (thanks to @Belerith):

**Version 1!** We go full throttle and increase the pace just a tad!

|Week|Start Date|End Page|End Phrase|Pages|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Week 11|Dec 14|160|スカートのすそをおぼえている。|16|
|Week 12|Dec 21|177|あんまりだと思う。|16|
|Week 13|Dec 28|193|The End|17|

Advantage: We’ll be done before the New Year and go into it with a ‘clean slate’. (Possibly. The last week will end in January. Last Discord session will also be in the New Year.)
Disadvantage: We’ll be increasing the pace -> People who celebrate the holidays might have less time to read and not be able to keep up.

**Version 2!** We… dont!

|Week|Start Date|End Page|End Phrase|Pages|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Week 11|Dec 14|159|年相応の顔をする。|14|
|Week 12|Dec 21|171|私は笑った。|12|
|Week 13|Dec 28|181|そして眠りについた。|11|
|Week 14|Jan 5|193|The End|12|

Advantage: We relax the pace a bit -> More time to prepare and enjoy the holidays for the people who celebrate.
Disadvantage: It’ll take longer to read. :man_shrugging:
