## Read-along Sessions

Come and read from the previous week's section, join in the chat about this book _(also the previous book, possible future books, WK reviews, all things Japan-related, what else you did on the weekend, etc)_ or just lurk and listen.  Readers of all speeds and abilities welcome - we are here to help each other out. Reading sessions will be held every $readAlongWeekday$ at $readAlongJSTHuman$ JST. 

Starting date: One week after we started reading the book, i.e. $readAlongFirstDate$.

Next session (in your timezone): [date=$readAlongNextDate$ time=$readAlongJSTComputer$ format="LLLL \T\Z " timezone="Japan" recurring="1.weeks"]
