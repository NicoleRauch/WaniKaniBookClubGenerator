If you want to take part... just buy the book and join in the discussion when we start on the 20th of June! There's a membership poll further down.

Not sure if this is for you? Check out the sample pages in the [Nomination Post](https://community.wanikani.com/t/x/19766/3100) - remember that your fellow book club members and the vocab sheet will be here to help you out though ;)

## Buy the Book

We are reading the **Collector's Edition** - if you are reading the eBook you'll need to buy the first *two* volumes of the original.

**Warning:** there is a spin-off series called 'Another', which has a very similar-looking front cover to the Collector's Edition.
