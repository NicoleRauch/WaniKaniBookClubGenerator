**Note:** There are two different versions available: The Kadokawa Bunko edition (beige-coloured with bananas), 200 pages, published in 1998, and the Shinchou Bunko edition (grey with tulips), 197 pages, published in 2002.
I compared the first few paragraphs of both and could not find any differences text-wise, but they might differ wrt. page breaks. This will be pointed out in the reading schedule.

 ## Reading Schedule 

#### Kitchen & Moonlight Shadow
